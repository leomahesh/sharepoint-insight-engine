This is a test document about Quantum Computing.
Quantum computing is a type of computation whose operations can exploit the phenomena of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement. Devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.
In contrast to classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.
This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, such as integer factorization and simulation of quantum systems.
However, building a stable quantum computer is extremely challenging due to decoherence and noise.
Leading companies like Google, IBM, and Microsoft are racing to build practical quantum computers.
